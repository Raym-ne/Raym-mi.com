                    <h1>Chapter of The Week</h1>
                    <h2> Chapter 2 — The Sinner’s Need of Christ </h2>

                    <p>Man was originally endowed with noble powers and a well-balanced mind. 
                        He was perfect in his being, and in harmony with God.
                       His thoughts were pure, his aims holy. But through disobedience,
                       his powers were perverted, and selfishness took the place of love.
                       His nature became so weakened through transgression that it was
                       impossible for him, in his own strength, to resist the power of evil.
                       He was made captive by Satan, and would have remained so forever
                       had not God specially interposed. It was the tempter’s purpose to
                       thwart the divine plan in man’s creation, and fill the earth with woe
                       and desolation. And he would point to all this evil as the result of
                       God’s work in creating man.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>In his sinless state, man held joyful communion with Him “in
                       whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.” Colossians 2:3. 
                       But after his sin, he could no longer find joy in holiness,
                       and he sought to hide from the presence of God. Such is still the
                       condition of the unrenewed heart. It is not in harmony with God, and
                       finds no joy in communion with Him. The sinner could not be happy
                       in God’s presence; he would shrink from the companionship of holy
                       beings. Could he be permitted to enter heaven, it would have no joy
                       for him. The spirit of unselfish love that reigns there—every heart
                       responding to the heart of Infinite Love—would touch no answering
                       chord in his soul. His thoughts, his interests, his motives, would be
                       alien to those that actuate the sinless dwellers there. He would be a [18]
                       discordant note in the melody of heaven. Heaven would be to him
                       a place of torture; he would long to be hidden from Him who is its
                       light, and the center of its joy. It is no arbitrary decree on the part of
                       God that excludes the wicked from heaven; they are shut out by their
                       own unfitness for its companionship. The glory of God would be to
                       them a consuming fire. They would welcome destruction, that they
                       might be hidden from the face of Him who died to redeem them..</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>It is impossible for us, of ourselves, to escape from the pit of
                       sin in which we are sunken. Our hearts are evil, and we cannot
                       change them. “Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?
                       not one.” “The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
                       subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.” Job 14:4; Romans
                       8:7. Education, culture, the exercise of the will, human effort, all
                       have their proper sphere, but here they are powerless. They may
                       produce an outward correctness of behavior, but they cannot change
                       the heart; they cannot purify the springs of life. There must be a
                       power working from within, a new life from above, before men can
                       be changed from sin to holiness. That power is Christ. His grace
                       alone can quicken the lifeless faculties of the soul, and attract it to
                       God, to holiness.</p>

                    <p>The Saviour said, “Except a man be born from above,” unless
                       he shall receive a new heart, new desires, purposes, and motives,
                       leading to a new life, “he cannot see the kingdom of God.” John
                       3:3, margin. The idea that it is necessary only to develop the good
                       that exists in man by nature, is a fatal deception. “The natural man
                       receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness
                       unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
                       discerned.” “Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.”
                       1 Corinthians 2:14; John 3:7. Of Christ it is written, “In Him was
                       life; and the life was the light of men”—the only “name under heaven
                       given among men, whereby we must be saved.” John 1:4; Acts 4:12.</p>
                        <br>       
                    <p>It is not enough to perceive the loving-kindness of God, to see
                       the benevolence, the fatherly tenderness, of His character. It is not
                       enough to discern the wisdom and justice of His law, to see that it
                       is founded upon the eternal principle of love. Paul the apostle saw
                       all this when he exclaimed, “I consent unto the law that it is good.”
                       “The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.”
                       But he added, in the bitterness of his soul-anguish and despair, “I
                       am carnal, sold under sin.” Romans 7:16, 12, 14. He longed for the
                       purity, the righteousness, to which in himself he was powerless to
                       attain, and cried out, “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver
                       me from this body of death?” Romans 7:24, margin. Such is the cry
                       that has gone up from burdened hearts in all lands and in all ages.
                       To all, there is but one answer, “Behold the Lamb of God, which
                       taketh away the sin of the world.” John 1:29.
                        </p>
                        <br>                       
                    <p>Many are the figures by which the Spirit of God has sought to
                       illustrate this truth, and make it plain to souls that long to be freed
                       from the burden of guilt. When, after his sin in deceiving Esau,
                       Jacob fled from his father’s home, he was weighed down with a
                       sense of guilt. Lonely and outcast as he was, separated from all that [20]
                       had made life dear, the one thought that above all others pressed
                       upon his soul, was the fear that his sin had cut him off from God, that
                       he was forsaken of Heaven. In sadness he lay down to rest on the
                       bare earth, around him only the lonely hills, and above, the heavens
                       bright with stars. As he slept, a strange light broke upon his vision;
                       and lo, from the plain on which he lay, vast shadowy stairs seemed
                       to lead upward to the very gates of heaven, and upon them angels
                       of God were passing up and down; while from the glory above, the
                       divine voice was heard in a message of comfort and hope. Thus was
                       made known to Jacob that which met the need and longing of his
                       soul—a Saviour. With joy and gratitude he saw revealed a way by
                       which he, a sinner, could be restored to communion with God. The
                       mystic ladder of his dream represented Jesus, the only medium of
                       communication between God and man.</p>
                        <br>                       
                    <p>This is the same figure to which Christ referred in His conversation with Nathanael, 
                        when He said, “Ye shall see heaven open,
                       and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of
                       man.” John 1:51. In the apostasy, man alienated himself from God;
                       earth was cut off from heaven. Across the gulf that lay between,
                       there could be no communion. But through Christ, earth is again
                       linked with heaven. With His own merits, Christ has bridged the
                       gulf which sin had made, so that the ministering angels can hold
                       communion with man. Christ connects fallen man in his weakness
                       and helplessness with the Source of infinite power.</p>
                        <br>                       
                    <p>But in vain are men’s dreams of progress, in vain all efforts for [21]
                       the uplifting of humanity, if they neglect the one Source of hope
                       and help for the fallen race. “Every good gift and every perfect gift”
                       (James 1:17) is from God. There is no true excellence of character
                       apart from Him. And the only way to God is Christ. He says, “I am
                       the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but
                       by Me.” John 14:6.

                    <p>The heart of God yearns over His earthly children with a love
                       stronger than death. In giving up His Son, He has poured out to us
                       all heaven in one gift. The Saviour’s life and death and intercession,
                       the ministry of angels, the pleading of the Spirit, the Father working
                       above and through all, the unceasing interest of heavenly beings,—
                       all are enlisted in behalf of man’s redemption.</p>
                        <br>                       
                    <p>Oh, let us contemplate the amazing sacrifice that has been made
                       for us! Let us try to appreciate the labor and energy that Heaven is
                       expending to reclaim the lost, and bring them back to the Father’s
                       house. Motives stronger, and agencies more powerful, could never
                       be brought into operation; the exceeding rewards for right-doing,
                       the enjoyment of heaven, the society of the angels, the communion
                       and love of God and His Son, the elevation and extension of all our
                       powers throughout eternal ages—are these not mighty incentives
                       and encouragements to urge us to give the heart’s loving service to
                       our Creator and Redeemer?
                        </p> 
                        <br>                       
                    <p>And, on the other hand, the judgments of God pronounced
                       against sin, the inevitable retribution, the degradation of our character, a
                        nd the final destruction, are presented in God’s word to warn us
                       against the service of Satan.</p> 
                        <br>                        
                    <p>Shall we not regard the mercy of God? What more could He
                       do? Let us place ourselves in right relation to Him who has loved us
                       with amazing love. Let us avail ourselves of the means provided for
                       us that we may be transformed into His likeness, and be restored to
                       fellowship with the ministering angels, to harmony and communion
                       with the Father and the Son.</p> 
                        <br>                        
                   <!--- <p>None but the Son of God could accomplish our redemption; for
                        only He who was in the bosom of the Father could declare Him.
                        Only He who knew the height and depth of the love of God could
                        make it manifest. Nothing less than the infinite sacrifice made by
                        Christ in behalf of fallen man could express the Father’s love to lost
                        humanity.</p>  
                        <br>                        
                    <p>“God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son.”
                        He gave Him not only to live among men, to bear their sins, and
                        die their sacrifice. He gave Him to the fallen race. Christ was to
                        identify Himself with the interests and needs of humanity. He who
                        was one with God has linked Himself with the children of men by
                        ties that are never to be broken. Jesus is “not ashamed to call them
                        brethren” (Hebrews 2:11); He is our Sacrifice, our Advocate, our
                        Brother, bearing our human form before the Father’s throne, and
                        through eternal ages one with the race He has redeemed—the Son
                        of man. And all this that man might be uplifted from the ruin and

                        degradation of sin that he might reflect the love of God and share
                        the joy of holiness.
                        </p>   
                        <br>                        
                    <p>The price paid for our redemption, the infinite sacrifice of our
                        heavenly Father in giving His Son to die for us, should give us
                        exalted conceptions of what we may become through Christ. As the
                        inspired apostle John beheld the height, the depth, the breadth of the
                        Father’s love toward the perishing race, he was filled with adoration
                        and reverence; and, failing to find suitable language in which to
                        express the greatness and tenderness of this love, he called upon the
                        world to behold it. “Behold, what manner of love the Father hath
                        bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.” 1 John
                        3:1. What a value this places upon man! Through transgression the
                        sons of man become subjects of Satan. Through faith in the atoning
                        sacrifice of Christ the sons of Adam may become the sons of God.
                        By assuming human nature, Christ elevates humanity. Fallen men
                        are placed where, through connection with Christ, they may indeed
                        become worthy of the name “sons of God.”</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>Such love is without a parallel. Children of the heavenly King!
                        Precious promise! Theme for the most profound meditation! The
                        matchless love of God for a world that did not love Him! The
                        thought has a subduing power upon the soul and brings the mind into
                        captivity to the will of God. The more we study the divine character
                        in the light of the cross, the more we see mercy, tenderness, and
                        forgiveness blended with equity and justice, and the more clearly we
                        discern innumerable evidences of a love that is infinite and a tender
                        pity surpassing a mother’s yearning sympathy for her wayward child.

                                American author, her works having been published in more than 160
                                languages. She wrote more than 100,000 pages on a wide variety of
                                spiritual and practical topics. Guided by the Holy Spirit, she exalted
                                Jesus and pointed to the Scriptures as the basis of one’s faith.
